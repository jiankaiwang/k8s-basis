Kubernetes is a container management platform and empowers the scalability to the container. In this repository, we address the issues of how to use Kubernetes with real cases. We start from the basic objects in Kubernetes, Pods, deployments, and Services. This repository is also a tutorial for those with advanced containerization skills trying to step into the Kubernetes. We also provide several YAML examples for those looking for quickly deploying services. Please enjoy it and let's start the journey to Kubernetes.
